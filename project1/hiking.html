            Solheimajokull glacier is an outlet from the might Myrdaisjokull and is surrounded by some of
            Iceland's most grand volcanoes and during summertime, a glacier lagoon forms in front of the glacier
            only adding to the charm of the location. This popular day tour is the perfect way to get in real contact 
            with the true reason behind the name Ice-land!
